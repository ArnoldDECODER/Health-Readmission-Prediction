Health Readmission Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days based on various health and demographic factors.

Data
The dataset used in this project is health_readmissions.csv. It contains the following columns:

age
sex
residence_type
systolic_bp
diastolic_bp
cholesterol
hemoglobin
past_visits
length_of_stay
insurance_status
readmitted_within_30days (target variable)
Project Steps
Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the data structure, identify missing values, and understand the distribution of features.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical features to prepare the data for model training.
Feature Selection: Use techniques like Mutual Information to identify the most relevant features for predicting readmission.
Model Training: Train a classification model (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors) on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Code Overview
The notebook contains code for:

Loading the data (health_readmissions.csv).
Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Applying Mutual Information for feature selection.
Training a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.
Evaluating the model's performance.
